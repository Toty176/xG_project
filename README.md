# ‚öΩ Expected Goals (xG) Prediction Model

This project presents a machine learning-based approach to predict **Expected Goals (xG)** in football (soccer) matches. The model is trained on relevant match data and provides insights into shot quality and scoring probability.

## üß† Model Overview

The project uses supervised learning techniques (likely XGBoost or similar) to train an xG model that evaluates the quality of each shot taken during a football match based on features such as:
- Shot distance
- Angle
- Body part used
- Game context (e.g. game state, pressure)
